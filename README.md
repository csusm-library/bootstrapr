Bootstrap.r
==========

Bootstrap.r is designed for essentially two use cases:

- CODERS -- You already write HTML and perhaps use the Bootstrap 3 libraries, and want to rapidly build and customize Bootstrap components for full-featured, Bootstrap-enabled mobile-frienly websites.

- NOT-SO-MUCH-CODERS -- You’re mayyybe familiar with the basics of HTML but your anxiety is directly proportional to the amount of code you’re facing. Still, you’d love to to add powerful, easily-customizable Bootstrap components to any of the many 3rd-party applications built on Bootstrap, such as Canvas, Moodle, Sakai, LibGuides, etc.—especially if you didn’t have to write any code…?

### Free & Open Source
Bootstrap.r is released under an MIT license.
