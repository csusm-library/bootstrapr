Bootstrapr
==========

Bootstrapr is designed for essentially two use cases:

- CODERS -- You already write HTML and perhaps use the Bootstrap 3 libraries, and want to rapidly build and customize Bootstrap components for full-featured, Bootstrap-enabled mobile-friendly websites.

- THE CODE-ISH or CODE-LY -- You’re mayyybe familiar with the basics of HTML but your anxiety is directly proportional to the amount of code you’re facing. Still, you’d love to to add powerful, easily-customizable Bootstrap components to any of the many 3rd-party applications or Learning Management Systems built on Bootstrap, such as LibGuides and Sakai, respectively ... especially if you didn’t have to write any code…?

### Free & Open Source
Bootstrapr is released under an MIT license, so ... yes, you can haz!
